# Works

## CODER

To configure devices in a software defined network (SDN), e.g., packets routes, network functions location and resource allocation, serveral high-level abstractions and languages, like Merlin and SNAP, are developed. CODER provides an common immediate representation for all SDN languages, defines precise semantic of combining SDN programs, and lets SDN programs written in different languages work together. With CODER user has more power on configuring SDN.

## Rubik

Rubik is a network stack parser generator for network function middleboxes. It provides a programming model for network protocols and protocol stacks with handful abstractions like flow table and reordered buffer. With Rubik, user can write only hundreds of lines of configuration, which will be transformed into tens of thousands of lines of C code. The generated protocol parser is more efficient than any human-writing ones.

## [WIP]

* A run-to-complete NFV framework which can provide isolation with PKU, and can run existing NFs with custom dynimical library loader.
* A BFT protocol which eliminate consensus overhead with programmable switch.

# Projects

## Shift Saver

A VSCode extension which provides a "shift saving" mode. In the mode all space and hypen typing will be treated as underscore or capitilization, which makes naming variables shift-key-free. I also made a [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1FT4y1K7fn) to introduce it.
